As soon scan requires to put somewhere mib values inside e.g. address
information (which need to compared to source address settings (mib)?)
then it's no longer a phy operation -> wpan_phy, it is binded to a
wpan_dev (mac instance on a phy). But the addresses are set to NONE
address type?
I am not sure where all that data is stored right now for a scan
operation, if it's operating on a phy it should be stored on wpan_phy.

Note: there are also differences between wpan_phy and
ieee802154_local, also wpan_dev and ieee802154_sub_if_data structures.
It has something to do with visibility and SoftMAC vs HardMAC, however
the last one we don't really have an infrastructure for and we
probably need to move something around there. In short
wpan_phy/wpan_dev should be only visible by HardMAC (I think) and the
others are only additional data for the same instances used by
mac802154...
