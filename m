SoftMAC vs HardMAC, look at timing critical "things".

make atusb more generic?

just send patches marked as RFC.

if its used a serial connection over usb? (You don't need to do that)
maybe virtual dummy that can be connected with hwsim?

Use documentation/ in the kernel source, but be warned we don't update
them a lot...

Look in "documentation/".

>   - Testing strategies and requirements

If you say you tested it and I don't have the hardware I need to trust
you... however the mentioned above to have a way to connect it to
hwsim it would be nice.

We make a difference between HardMAC and SoftMAC. It depends how much
MAC logic (especially MLME-ops are done on the firmware of the
transceiver) although SoftMAC also does some MAC functionality that is
necessarily to run on the firmware because of timing critical
infrastructure, e.g. AACK/ARET handling.

Given the fact that we support SoftMAC you probably want to have a
SoftMAC firmware/driver. I think it is best to look at several SoftMAC
transceivers, also on atusb, atusb is very specific to the current
transceiver which is soldered on the transceiver stick. You should be
able to make some "generic" layer on top to do something that your
firmware supports the specific transceiver but the driver on the Linux
side stays the same.

Bluetooth has HCI which is part of their stack (one reason why it is
successful) but wpan IEEE standard doesn't do such specification, you
are on your own here to establish an open one which might others will
follow or not.
