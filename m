Monitor interfaces are not anything that the spec describes, it is
some interface type which offers the user (mostly over AF_PACKET raw
socket) full phy level access with the _default_ options. I already
run user space stacks (for hacking/development only) on monitor
interfaces to connect with Linux 802.15.4 interfaces, e.g. see [0]
(newer came upstream, somewhere I have also a 2 years old updated
version, use hwsim not fakelb).

In other words, by default it should bypass 802.15.4 MAC and it still
conforms with your spec, just that it is in user space. However, there
exists problems to do that, but it kind of works for the most use
cases. I said here by default because some people have different use
cases of what they want to do in the kernel. e.g. encryption (so users
only get encrypted frames, etc.) We don't support that but we can,
same for doing a scan. It probably requires just more mac802154 layer
filtering.

There are enough examples in wireless that they do "crazy" things and
you can do that only with SoftMAC transceivers because it uses more
software parts like mac80211 and HardMAC transceivers only do what the
spec says and delivers it to the next layer. Some of them have more
functionality I guess, but then it depends on driver implementation
and a lot of other things.

Monitors also act as a sniffer device, but you _could_ also send
frames out and then the fun part begins.

On SoftMAC it need to support a filtering level where we can disable
all filtering and get 802.15.4 MAC frames like it's on air (even
without non valid checksum, but we simply don't care if the
driver/transceiver does not support it we will always confirm it is
correct again until somebody comes around and say "oh we can do FCS
level then mac802154 does not need to check on this because it is
always correct")... This is currently the NONE filtering level I
think?

For HardMAC it is more complicated; they don't do that, they do the
"scan" operation on their transceiver and you can dump the result and
probably never forward any beacon related frames? (I had this question
once when Michael Richardson replied).
