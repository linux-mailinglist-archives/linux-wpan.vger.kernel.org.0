But why do we need to have a done command?

Sorry, I still don't get that.

"trigger + monitor" there is no done command needed here or? The
process should unblock when it's done, and for SIGINT/SIGKILL send an
abort? Maybe a done event when the scan is "successful" finished and
everything that was there in the channel/page combinations was scanned
without an abort.

We need to consider that other processes listen to events? They should
be aware of what's happening there? There should be some event
sequence going on "trigger event" + "loop of found something event" +
"either abort or done"?

Yea, monitor sounds like ip monitor, udevadm monitor, etc. to listen
to all those 802.15.4 subsystem events. I would take a look into it
for any scan results. At the end you should be able to do a blocked
scan and monitor at the same time and they should at least provide
similar events.
Probably the blocked scan with nicer output and filtered and the
monitor is for everything that is going on in 802.15.4 there.
