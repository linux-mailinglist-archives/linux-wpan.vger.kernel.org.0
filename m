Yes

I do not mind any of the two methods. Getting Github and mailing lists 
working together is to big of a task on its own for such a small project 
to tackle in my opinion.

Given the low volumes of patches we are seeing on wpan-tools and maybe 
also rpld I would not mind if we say that we accept both ways. Mailing 
patches as well as pull requests. That would ease the contributions for 
some people I hope. And while it puts a bit more burden on us it should 
not be to hard given the low volume.

Signed off by makes only sense if we have a document descriping what we 
mean by it. If we want it and use the one from the kernel we need to 
communicate this clearly. If not, the sign offs are off no use.
