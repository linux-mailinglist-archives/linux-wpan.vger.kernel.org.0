That sounds fine to me. Adrei, what do you think about this change?

I was hoping that we could cover what we need with the current spec and 
we could just add more capability flags for new things. We could got the 
full way to have a protocol version during the init as well.

 From what I have seen this listen before talk is often (always?) a 
hardware feature of sub GHz (where its needed) transceivers. I would 
assume this just makes sure we pass the config from linux stack through 
the driver to the firmware.

Good

While we do not support this in the Linux stack yet, we should still 
make sure the spec here is capable of supporting this.

Hmm, we do not have that. But getting the info from the firmware would 
be useful.

Is there a way to the device in promiscuous mode?

Currently the spec only covers LQI, but getting extra stats on the 
reliability could bring in some extra benefit for routing decisions.

Yes, exactly, with the capabilities we get during init from the firmware 
it can be signalled what it supports and we would enable the needed 
device ops for the Linux stack ased on this.
