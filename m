Hi Victhor,

> I'm working on a project to implement a 6LoWPAN network using software de=
fined radios. I'm trying to interface the kernel's 802.15.4/6LoWPAN stacks =
to my physical layer implemented in GNU Radio, instead of using a userspace=
 stack, but this isn't working very well.

 I'd like to get around its limitations (such as not being able to change d=
estination addresses at runtime) using the Linux kernel stack.

It's possible to change the destination address. Do you use af802154?

> The way this is being done is I have socat piping between a mac802154_hws=
im interface and GNU Radio, using the following arguments: INTERFACE:wpan0 =
UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:<port>
> GNU Radio is running a UDP server at <port> that transmits and receives P=
DUs to/from the software defined PHY, which then goes out to a software def=
ined radio device (a USRP N210, in this case). So the PDUs are sent via the=
 socat pipe to the hwsim network interface and vice-versa. The 802.15.4 MAC=
 block is removed.

Mhh, do you can provide more information about the setup so I can test
it on my own? Do you took care about channel/page and panid settings?


> During testing, I had packet capture set up on both the 802.15.4 ("wpan0"=
) and the 6LoWPAN ("lowpan0") interfaces. The wpan0 interface was receiving=
 packets from the other host (and also from itself, as the radio is full du=
plex), as expected. However, I could not get wpan-ping to work (timeout) an=
d ping6, netcat, etc. wouldn't get a response from the other host.
> On the lowpan0 interface, I could see the packets originating from applic=
ations would appear on the packet capture log, but those that should be com=
ing from the wpan0 interface wouldn't, even those originating from the host=
 itself (due to the full duplex nature of the radio).

No idea, this is now your gnuradio device?

This looks that you receive encrypted frames, it might be only the
frame control field is misleading and security is enabled, can you
check?

> What could be done to get the 6LoWPAN stack to accept packets injected in=
to the 802.15.4 interface by socat? I realize this is a very unusual situat=
ion, but I'm not familiar with the Linux 802.15.4 stack.

No idea, sorry for my late reply. Can you provide more information?
