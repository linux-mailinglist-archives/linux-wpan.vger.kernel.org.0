It is.

I had a chance to talk to the author a while back. Not much activity 
from his side.

For me this needs to be designed in a way where we could have bare 
metal, Zephyr, RIOT or Contiki based firmware implementing the interface 
and the driver would just work. The code available is a good start but 
needs more work.

I was, and somehow still am, planning on working on this. But with the 
world turned upside down there was always something else to look at 
before. Its on my list, just not very high. If anyone wants to have a 
stab at this feel free and let me know.

Feel free to keep me in the loop. Would be happy to participate again if 
time allows.
