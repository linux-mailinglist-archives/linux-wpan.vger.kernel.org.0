I don't see what advantage it has to keep the discovered pan in the
kernel. You can do everything with a start/stop/pan discovered event.
It also has more advantages as you can look for a specific pan and
stop afterwards.
At the end the daemon has everything that the kernel also has, as you
said it's in sync.

This isn't either a kernel job to decide which pan it will be associated with.

This has nothing to do with memory.

Will it get more used than caching entries in the kernel for user
space? Please also no in-kernel association feature.

We can maybe agree to that point to put it under
IEEE802154_NL802154_EXPERIMENTAL config, as soon as we have some
_open_ user space program ready we will drop this feature again...
this program will show that there is no magic about it.
