I doubt that I will be happy with this solution, this all sounds like
"for the specific current behaviour that we support 2 filtering levels
it will work", just do a parameter on which 802.15.4 filtering level
it was received and the rx path will check what kind of filter is
required and which not.
As driver ops start() callback you should say which filtering level
the receive mode should start with.

Never looked much in 802.15.4 receive path as it just worked but I
said that there might be things to clean up when filtering things on
hardware and when on software and I have the feeling we are doing
things twice. Sometimes it is also necessary to set some skb fields
e.g. PACKET_HOST, etc. and I think this is what the most important
part of it is there. However, there are probably some tune ups if we
know we are in third leveling filtering...
