PARAGUAY THOUGH I TRIED MY BEST TO INVOLVE YOU IN THE GOLD/DIAMOND,
BUSINESS BUT GOD DECIDED THE WHOLE SITUATIONS. PRESENTLY I AM IN
UNITED ARAB EMIRATES FOR INVESTMENT PROJECTS WITH MY OWN SHARE OF THE
TOTAL SUM.

MEANWHILE, I DIDN'T FORGET YOU=E2=80=99RE PAST EFFORTS AND ATTEMPTS TO ASSI=
ST
ME IN TRANSFERRING THOSE FUNDS DESPITE THAT IT FAILED US SOMEHOW.

NOW CONTACT MY SECRETARY IN BURKINA FASO.

THAT TIME VERY MUCH. SO FEEL FREE AND GET IN TOUCHED WITH MY

PARTNER SUPPORTED YOU ALSO WITH SUM OF ($ 1000000.00 USD) FROM HIS OWN
SHARE ALSO BECAUSE I EXPLAIN THE WHOLE THING TO HIM THAT YOU ARE THE
FIRST PERSON I CONTACTED THAT WANTED TO ASSIST ME BUT YOU COULD NOT
MAKE IT AND HE SAID OKAY THERE IS NO PROBLEM.

SO THAT YOU WILL KEPT THE WHOLE SECRET ABOUT MY SUCCESS BECAUSE I KNEW
THAT IT WAS ONLY YOU KNOW HOW I MADE THE MONEY SO TRY TO KEPT
EVERYTHING VERY SECRET. I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND THE REASON WHY THIS HUGE
AMOUNT OF FUNDS WAS KEPT FOR YOU?

PLEASE DO LET ME KNOW IMMEDIATELY YOU RECEIVE THE VISA CARD SO THAT WE
CAN SHARE THE JOY AFTER ALL THE SUFFERINGS AT THAT TIME. IN THE
MOMENT, I AM VERY BUSY HERE BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENT PROJECTS WHICH I
AND THE NEW PARTNER ARE HAVING AT HAND, FINALLY,

BEHALF TO RECEIVE THAT MONEY, SO FEEL FREE TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH HIM,
SO THAT HE WILL SEND THE VISA CARD VALUE SUM OF ($2.500, 000.00.USD)
TWO MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS TO YOU WITHOUT
