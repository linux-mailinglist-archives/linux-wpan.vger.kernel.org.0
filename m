I feel so bad. All the instructions I could find (from 2011) advised to
download an old gcc, an old binutils and old avr-lib, to compile
everything by hand... 2 out of 3 archives returned a 404 error, the
builds were chaotic I had to disable -Werror and fix many issues
manually, then I had to fight with binutils assembler failing, I tried
4 different versions before I got it right... I did write a commit to
update the instructions but if you say that just downloading the stock
pre-compiled binaries worked I am a bit disappointed because the
instructions specifically told not to do so.

Yes, dfu worked right away, very nice tool.

Actually I'm wrong.
You did: *(skb->data + 1), which works.
I did: skb->data[1], which does not.
I thought that my mistake was related to data being a void *, but it's
a char * so both should work. I don't know why it failed, maybe my
attention level was too low and I missed something else.
