I think it depends what exactly the difference is. So far I see for
address filtering it should be the same. Maybe this is an interface
option then?

What does it mean "algorithm is beyond the spec" - build your own?

When the hardware does not support it, it should be forbidden. As most
transceivers have only one address filter it should be forbidden
then... but there exists a way to indeed have such a setup (which you
probably don't need to think about). It's better to forbid something
now, with the possibility later allowing it. So it should not break
any existing behaviour.

I think this can be done all with some "fallback strategies" (build
your own) if it's not given as a parameter.

I thought the spec said "or otherwise"? That means if nothing can be
found, create one?
