Honestly, we still need to figure out if we really have a problem
here. Quick lookup I think we need to figure out how [0] somehow
works. Maybe we don't have no issue because it looks like this
"translates" if a queue is

if (!netif_xmit_frozen_or_stopped(txq))

to return "NETDEV_TX_BUSY" when the queue is stopped and it already
works like it should be. But I am asking myself why we have some
"NETDEV_TX_BUSY" then for the driver level? Maybe some historic return
value?

That is a BIG todo here because the qdisc should be optimized for the
network that we have here, which is a LLN, Low-power and lossy
network. It's not, because the tx queue length is currently at 300
[1], which is ridiculous for 802.15.4, it should be lower but don't
ask me about the exact numbers... There needs to be more research
regarding qdisc and tx queue length and how everything works together.
I am not sure if some IEEE/IETF papers exist regarding this. I am
seeing papers evaluating Linux 802.15.4 but they completely ignore the
current situation here, that is what I mean with "it's in a working
condition only".

I cc mcr here, he is active at the IETF ROLL group and may know more
about the topic.

I know  we have a very ugly behaviour in 6LoWPAN (and I think in
general in IPv4/v6) that we don't drop all fragments in the queue when
one gets dropped. I asked this at [2] and what I got is a confirmation
that this "ugly" behaviour is currently the case. Fragments are frames
belonging to something bigger in upper layer protocols, if one gets
dropped it can never be reassembled at the receiver's side. This might
have "okay" effects on ethernet and co, but on LNNs it is terrible.

This is however a problem which I know exists. And don't ask me if a
user space protocol doing fragments can give the kernel "hints" that
everything belongs to something bigger... this is a topic for Linux
networking conferences.
