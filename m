I can't deal with the github gui! I click always the wrong buttons
there. Thanks for setting up this travis support, does it work like
wpan-tools to push it into branch "coverity_scan"?
I would like to review patches via mail, what do you prefer? What is
the procedure when somebody submits pull requests on github then,
somebody of us send it via mail? Sounds more work... Can we do both as
"whatever you like"? Can github somehow send pull request via github
to this mailinglist? Would be nice to have something to connect the
whole github thing to a mailinglist and you can control it with that
as well... at least the commenting system but I think this isn't
possible and the new kids wants all pull request via github gui. We
didn't answered this question for wpan-tools as well and I once
clicked the "merge" button (actually not by accident).

Also how we do that with signed off by thing? I can still fix it
somehow what I did there...
