I see some familiar nicks there ;-)

Sounds good. If you want to email me directly I can see if I can fit
it into the current project, or even see if I can work with the
original wpanusb author.

That is dedication ;-) Hopefully this winter I should have some
dedicated manufacturing space, so I'm looking forward to spinning out
a few OSHW boards too.

Excellent!

I also found this which seems like it should be supported (with
something out of linux-firmware maybe?)
