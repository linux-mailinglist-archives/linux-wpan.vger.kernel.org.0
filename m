I would define the difference in bypass qdisc or not. Whereas the
qdisc can drop or delay transmitting... For me, the qdisc is currently
in a "works for now" state.

then bypassing qdisc would be better.

hwsim should work. But again don't trust the transmit side, there are
currently problems. Wireshark has also a feature to give the key and
encrypt on the fly for 802.15.4.
