Yeah, I did not bother with it as it was off topic. I believe the call
above would anyway not be affected.

You're totally right, this is misleading. I will just drop this
definition and its use, see below.

Absolutely.

The code above was misleading, I will clarify it to only accept NL
association commands with an extended address. In fact the coord
structure is created in the nl802154 layer and it already only accepts
extended addresses (we don't expect the short address through the nl
command) so to answer your request: yes, the extended address will
always be there because we must know it.

Regarding the possibility to provide a short address, as we no longer
keep details about the surrounding devices inside the kernel (we only
keep the associated devices, either the parent or the children) keeping
this information would be useless. I don't see a need for it. The
NL interface can evolve later without breaking the compatibility if we
ever want to provide a short address as well and make something with it
(actually even today one could send the short address, it would simply
be ingored).

One thing however regarding the fact that we might want to store both a
short *and* an extended address in some cases: I created a "PAN device"
structure which allows this (because otherwise we had a union) as we
need to do it when we are parent as we are in charge of allocating the
short addresses:

+/**
+ * struct ieee802154_pan_device - PAN device information
+ * @pan_id: the PAN ID of this device
+ * @mode: the preferred mode to reach the device
+ * @short_addr: the short address of this device
+ * @extended_addr: the extended address of this device
+ * @node: the list node
+ */
+struct ieee802154_pan_device {
+       __le16 pan_id;
+       u8 mode;
+       __le16 short_addr;
+       __le64 extended_addr;
+       struct list_head node;
+};

No no, I think we are fully aligned :-)

Yeah but I believe once we have proper PAN IDs/short address vs
extended address mappings we could have the translation internally at
least. I haven't investigated this for now.
