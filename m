#linux-wpan at Freenode :-)

I would still expect that each RTOS has their own firmware to adapt 
their ieee802154 abstraction and supported hw to the generic wpanusb 
driver. The USB interface they expose would be the same, and behave the 
same though.

I agree.

If work is going on for this and you are getting an idea on the level of 
abstraction I would be happy to discuss how this should result in a 
generic wpanusb driver.

ATUSB are still being produced and sold:
http://shop.sysmocom.de/products/atusb

Sysmocom is doing small batches (100-200 pieces) whenever their stock 
goes low. The price is not really making money for them and is mostly 
covering their expenses. Its one of their many contributions to help 
Open Source projects with hardware. (As you most likely can read from 
this I am _very_ happy they are handling all the hardware manufacturing 
and logistics for this).

I am flashing every single one of these atusb's by hand as well (for 
free, just to keep the supply alive). :-)

The available CC2531 dongles would be available for ~10 USD from China, 
but there is no driver support (it would be a perfect candidate for the 
wpanusb driver with a bare-metal firmware).

If the need it not USB but SPI there are plenty to choose from.
