I hard a hard time putting my two devices "far enough from each other"
on a radio POV, so I used a shielded bag, multiple USB cable
extensions, a microwave and my co-worker K=C3=B6ry to finally get a
reduced LQI. So nevermind, the hardware/firmware works as expected and
the firmware update we proposed recently did not break anything.

I however found a nasty bug in the way the LQI was stored in the stack
(the control buffer skb->cb was initialized/reset after the LQI got
stored there), I will soon propose a fix.

Sorry for the burden, patches are coming soon.

Thanks,
Miqu=C3=A8l
