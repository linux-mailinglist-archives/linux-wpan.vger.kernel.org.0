Hello,

We are working too on the same kind of features, I am “ni” on
#linux-wpan. For the moment, we have a quite advanced branch for
scanning (active and passive) which tries to mirror what is done in the
802.11 stack, written by David, and another branch for joining a PAN
by Thierry.

I would be interrested to see a rebase to better understand what you
have done.

I asked David to prepare a branch to share so we can see how to move
forward.

Nicolas.
