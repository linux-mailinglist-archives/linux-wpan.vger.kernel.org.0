I was chatting with him as well on Zephyr Slack and let him know that
there was significant interest in it going upstream. I worry though
that it might not be a high priority for his employer.

Is there a linux-wpan IRC? Would be nice to chat in real-time at some point.

I agree mostly. Of course each RTOS has their own headers, way of
declaring things, etc, but for the most part it could be platform
independent.

I'll bring it up in the Zephyr Slack. They want to incorporate it into
their "tools" repository, but it really should go into Linux at some
point.

We'll probably end up working on this for BB.O - even just having a
single driver that works for all boards in Zephyr is a pretty large
step.

Lastly, I feel like this is a recurring question, but a number of us
will likely need a bunch of 802.15.4 USB dongle to speak to our 15.4
nodes. I have a couple of ATUSB on my desk, but are there others in
our group that don't have any idea where to get parts, and likely
building one from scratch would be more time than they want to take.

Do you know of an off-the-shelf product that works with existing
drivers upstream?

M.f.G.

Chris
