Excellent! That was very helpful. I think I've found a nice way to use
those filtering levels, it's not something that we need for the scan to
work so I've queued those patches later, but in the end you were right,
it's much better than the ->promiscuous callback alone.

I've integrated your patches, let me come up with a final submission,
no worries about the v2, please just check v3 which will be much more
interesting.

Thanks,
