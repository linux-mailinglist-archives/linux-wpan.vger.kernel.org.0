Oh I'm not blaming anyone here ;)

By the way I would like to make a another round of tests because during
my demos I could observe a wrong LQI, and I don't remember if the LQI
was valid before my changes or not. I haven't got the time yet to get
back to it. Or maybe the devices were too close to each other? I don't
know, I'll need to figure it out so we don't break a useful existing
feature.

Thanks,
Miqu=C3=A8l
