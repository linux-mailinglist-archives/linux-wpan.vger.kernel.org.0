Koen will also have some time in August and expressed interest in 
working on it. I will be away on vacation first half of August. It would 
be great if you three can coordinate this a bit.

We have drivers for the sub-GHz band (at86rf212 and the HUL USB support 
in atusb which also uses the 212). We also have support for a 
listen-before-talk (LBT) driver operation to make that part work with 
the drivers.

To be honest I have not done sub-GHz testing myself here, but given the 
work people put into the at86rf212 support I would think it should work 
for some first tries. Reports welcome!
