Happy to see that we finally have the critical mass to get this moved 
forward. :-)

Here is my take on what I think needs to be done.

On a first review I found nothing wrong with the design. It needs 
further extending and flexibility in my opinion, though.

o Add a GET_EXTENDED_ADDR command to receive the extended address 
provided by the transceiver itself, or firmware in some way.

o Adding a GET_CAPABILITIES command to query device capabilities
  during init to enable and set needed ieee802154_ops based on the 
device. Given that we aim to support as many transceivers as possible we 
can't rely on static device knowledge to configure wpanusb correctly.

o Add opcode for set_lbt in USB spec

o Add opcode for set_frame_retries USB spec. (If a transceiver does not 
support AutoACK in hardware do Zephyr and RIOT support a software 
fallback to handle AutoACK?)

o How are we going to handle transceiver which allow MTUs > 127? Not a 
high priority as the kernel part does not support this either right now.

o Do Zephyr or RIOT expose additional functionality we should support here?

o Koen, you offered to look into implementing the firmware support for 
the USB spec in RIOT. Does the spec fit what RIOT has as abstraction for 
ieee802154?

o Adrei, Chris, I understand it you would work on the wpanusb as well as 
the Zephyr firmware side, correct?

o I see additional use cases for a bare metal firmwares (a different fw 
to support wpanusb on the atusb device or CC2531 comes to mind). But 
none of those are critical in the beginning.

Stefan Schmidt
