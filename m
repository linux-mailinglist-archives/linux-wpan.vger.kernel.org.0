sorry for the late reply. This was doing L2 and above in user space,
it was the Linux driver layer only... I thought it was about using
6LoWPAN until the transport layer in kernel and link-layer in user
space.
It also had some problems with ack handling and you will not really
use Linux then, however I was always thinking about to wrap a whole
library around openthread and do some daemon to using Linux then,
instead running an OS on an OS.
