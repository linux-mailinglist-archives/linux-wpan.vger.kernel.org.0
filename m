In my opinion there is definitely in case of a wpan interface a queue
handling right above xmit_do() which is in a "works for now" state.
Your queue flush function will not flush any queue, as I said it's
flushing the transceivers framebuffer at the starting point of
xmit_do() call and you should change your comments/function names to
describe this behaviour.
