yes, but no because then this will end in breaking UAPI because it
will be exported to uapi headers if we change them?
For now we say everybody needs to copy the header on their own into
their user space application if they want to use the API which means
it fits for the kernel that they copied from.

I would remove the CONFIG_IEEE802154_NL802154_EXPERIMENTAL config
option but don't move the header to "include/uapi/..." which means
that the whole nl802154 UAPI (and some others UAPIs) are still
experimental because it's not part of UAPI "directory".
btw: the whole subsystem is still experimental because f4671a90c418
("net/ieee802154: remove depends on CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL") was never
acked by any maintainer... but indeed has other reasons why it got
removed.
