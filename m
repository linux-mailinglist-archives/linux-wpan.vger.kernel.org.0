Yes, that's what I was saying, the two solutions are already supported.
The iwpan tool is being enhanced with the "scan" composite command,
- either "scan" is given an additional keyword and makes just that
  (trigger, abort, done) and returns as soon as this precise
  command is done (eg. it returns almost immediately on "trigger")
- or, no additional command is provided (only the parameters for the
  scan) and the command does an equivalent to "trigger + monitor +
  done" which blocks after launching the scan, shows the results when
  they arrive, and returns once the scan is finished.

Do you want something more? I just miss a "monitor" command I guess, I
may add it.

Thanks,
