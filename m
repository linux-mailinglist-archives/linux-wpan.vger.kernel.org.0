Hi everyone,

LPC is happening Sept 27-29 this year and is tentatively scheduled to
occur in Dublin, Ireland. However, there is a small chance it might be
virtual again. Things were obviously very crazy for a lot of people in
2020 and it's continuing into 2021 for many parts of the globe, so I
hope everyone is hanging in there.

Likely I will submit the IoT MC proposal today and I'm hopeful that it
will be accepted again. I don't have statistics handy, but I think our
attendance was actually up last year. Maybe being virtual actually
helped in that regard.

In any case, I also wanted to get everyone's gears turning to inspire
others to give a talk. I know that a number of us were working on
wpanusb for both Zephyr & RIOT and there was some momentum to get MLME
/ MAC Layer changes in as well.

If there are any cool developments that are happening, please don't
hesitate to reach out :-)

Cheers,

C
