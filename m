If you and Marcel don't mind I would like to switch this over to being 
merged through ieee802154. Mostly because 6lowpan is vital for the 15.4 
work we have.

With Jukka stepping down from co-maintaining this part (thanks a lot for 
your work!) this will most likely be reviewed by Alex and me anyway.

We still need to ensure that patches are hitting wpan as well as 
bluetooth mailing list, but the MAINTAINERS file handles this already.

Let me know if you are unhappy with the switch. If not I will start with 
merging these three as well as the MAINTAINERS update from Jukka.

regards
Stefan Schmidt
