Perhaps the tool --help would have helped to get the naming, but we
need:
- a command to start a scan, either use:
  * "scan" alone and it is synchronous, I mean the command returns when
    the scan is over
  or
  * "scan trigger" which is asynchronous, and returns immediately after
    starting the operation
- if the scan was started asynchronously with the "trigger" keyword,
  the "done" command will wait until the scan is over (maybe this one
  needs to be renamed?)
- if the user made a mistake and do not want to remain blocked for
  several minutes (a scan can last for very long time), we need the
  "abort" command to tell the kernel to stop and return to a standard
  state. Once this has been processed and the scan effectively stopped,
  the kernel will send a nl command saying the scan is over (which
  "scan done" would capture)

Thanks,
Miqu=C3=A8l
