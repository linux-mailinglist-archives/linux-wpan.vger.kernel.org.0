Setting up a router is considered to be at least an "administrator"
level. You need to at least provide a prefix. The RA message is from
the Linux kernel networking branch considered as a user space message
(on the transmit side, the receive side it's different), I doubt that
this will ever be changed. At the end the user needs to configure
something in any case.

It's also known as arp proxy on IPv4. Just google it, but for IPv6 you
need to have a daemon in the background to make it automatically
configured. Although I recommend at first to try it with a manual
setup by using iproute2.

Sure it works on BLE, but here you have a star topology where RPL
makes really no sense. It is just one parent with leaf-nodes and radvd
will do the same for you. From my point Bluetooth mesh topology is
supported by the kernel right now as link-layer but there is no
6LoWPAN adaptation (speaking on Linux kernel level, IETF has standards
for it) to run 6LoWPAN on BLE mesh topology. What we currently support
is the star topology one which is how Bluetooth works for decades.
Only on a mesh RPL becomes interesting.

I did not say that it does not work, I said it makes no sense to run
it on a link-layer star topology. If it's a mesh it looks different.

Another thing to test would be a 6CO option [0] which will allow
6lowpan to compress non link-layer prefixes. It makes sense to add one
like your prefix destination option in RA. For the arp/ndisc solution
you could simply reach all neighbors by its link-local address. To be
more clear, the arp/ndisc proxy needs to be configured on the device
which was before your "router", then magically all neighbors behind it
can be reachable by its link-local... if you want to access it behind
your local area network, then you indeed need a global prefix and
routing/gateway/etc..

Note that [0] never came upstream (except one patch) because the UAPI
in Linux kernel is not stable, I am working on it right now and my
progress is at about 25% to make the UAPI stable. :)
