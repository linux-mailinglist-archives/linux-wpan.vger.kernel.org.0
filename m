I am sorry, I never looked into Zephyr for reasons... Do they not have
something like /proc/interrupts look if you see a counter for your
802.15.4 transceiver?

Hardware filter is currently e.g. promiscuous mode on or off setting.
Software filtering is depending which receive path the frame is going
and which hardware filter is present which then acts like actually
with hardware filtering.
I am not sure if this answers this question?
