use the simplest approach. btw: 802.15.4 and ack handling has it's
"own" retransmit handling, but I think csma retries could happen
without setting the ack request bit. We should avoid that the user
gets an error "channel access failure" for doing an active scan, or
this maybe should be and the user can react to it? It would then
require that the user's implementation cares/is aware about such a
possibility and maybe does a simple retry on user level as well or
whatever they want then? However they are probably not happy to start
a whole scan again...

I am not sure what the right thing is... it is probably a rare case.
