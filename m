I don't think anyone has done RFC7668
  _IPv6 over BLUETOOTH(R) Low Energy_

for any BT device.  I would love to be wrong!!

Running BTLE mesh is something I'd really like to do.
My guess is that one could probably prototype this in userspace on top of
bluez, and then use Alex' 6lowpan tap interface.
