Hi,

sorry, just realized I used the info@ email ^^

 > What kind of workarounds? I am curious...

The radvd workaround to distribute a PD.
Ideally I would like it to be as plug & and play as possible.
Connecting the sensors to my router and passing down the PD 
automatically. At the end of the day, not everyone is a dev.

Btw, I am on Bluetooth 4.2. I had a hard time to even find non audio 
only Bluetooth 5.x USB sticks. Yes, it's only star topology so far. Even 
though, from my understanding, you could theoretically run a RPL network 
behind it.
There are more powerful MCUs that would be able to act as a RPL root.
Even though it probably would be better to use the linux border router 
as root. Puts less pressure on the sensor nodes.
I am not familiar with ndisc-proxy. If you could point me to some 
resources, that would be very helpful. Going to take a look into it.
Sharing the same prefix would be fine for now, since I only run it in a 
star topology anyway.
RPL should be, from my understanding, also work on BLE. RIOT allows 
three concurrent connections for BLE, as I remember.

I don't really understand why rpld only works in a mesh network.
When it runs on 6LoWPAN, it should also run on BLE, or am I missing 
something?

best regards
Philipp
