I have resumed work on this project, and I decided to implement a few
changes. I abandoned the socat approach and came up with a different
implementation, modifying the linux-wpan example programs.

I made two programs, one that receives packets from a wpan interface
and outputs them to a UDP port, while the other program receives
packets from a UDP port and sends them to a wpan interface. It seems
to work well enough, but there's a problem with my approach.

I need to get outgoing packets from the wpan interface. Is there a way
to filter packets coming through a raw socket, such that only outgoing
packets come out of the socket?

Right now, I'm not filtering for outgoing packets, so when packets are
received through my program and sent to the wpan interface, the same
packets come out of the interface, as there's no filtering being done,
causing a loop.

I tried using the sll_pkttype field in the raw socket structure, but
all packets received by the socket have the same value, so it's not
useful, unfortunately.
