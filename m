Hello.

[Added Erik here to be part of the discussion]

This mostly goes to Koen and Erik. Please coordinate how you are wanting 
to work on this. And be pro-active. Waiting for the other one to start 
will just lead to starving :-)


I started to hack together some parts as I would do them. Really not 
working at all right now and only compile tested. I will give more 
details below. I am not sure if I will find time to work more on this 
next week before I go on vacation, so here is what I have:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sschmidt/wpan-next.git/log/?h=wpanusb-original

Feel free to use any of it or ignore it if you have something better.
Really just my take in a really rushed break.

For the above I completely ignore the move to bulk. This still needs doing.

My take on this is in the above branch.

I started to work on this. The real questions is are we passing all the 
frequency bands and others settings through the USB spec or are we going 
with tables for these inside the firmware and driver and only reference 
them? The later is more efficient the first one is more flexible and 
likely more extensible for future changes.

How about we are using the USB version part of the descriptor for this? 
We would identify a newer version device not only the spec. The device 
handling could work on both.

Added a first take on this.

Added a first take on this. Needs USB helper functions to handle the 
config data being passed to the device.

This is completely ignored for now.

If I have time to do more work on this I will update you folks. As I 
wrote above. Read over it and feel free to use any of the above or 
implement it yourself.

Looking forward to the progress on this when back from my vacation. :-)
