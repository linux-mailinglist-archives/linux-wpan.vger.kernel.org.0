I am not sure if I understand this correctly but for me sending
beacons means something like "here is a pan which I broadcast around"
and then there is "'device' is not associated". Is when "associated"
(doesn't matter if set manual or due scan/assoc) does this behaviour
implies "I am broadcasting my pan around, because my panid is !=3D
0xffff" ?

so this will confirm, it should send beacons if panid !=3D 0xffff (as my
question above)?

Where is this "user choice"? I mean you handle those answers for
beacon requests in the kernel?

okay.

In the sense of "by the user" you don't mean putting this logic into
user space you want to do it in kernel and implement it as a
netlink-op, the same as wireless is doing? I just want to confirm
that. Of course everything else is different, but from this
perspective it should be realized.

Sure there should be a limitation about how many pans should be
allowed, that is somehow the bare minimum which should be there.
I was not quite sure how the user can decide of denied assoc or not,
but this seems out of scope for right now...

Who is keeping track of this relationship? So we store pans which we
found with a whole "subtree" attached to it?

btw: that sounds similar to me to what RPL is doing...,
