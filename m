Hello.

Sorry for the delay. I tagged the mail but still forgot about it. :(

Yay :-)

Hmm, I would need to check the spec as well. ieee802154 and mac802154 
should not really limit the used pages or channels. We have no regulator 
daemon or such in place (me might should though). IIRC we simply let the 
driver define its channel table.

Yes, if these could work simultaneously we should allow to expose both 
phy's. Exposing two USB devices from the firmware and let the kernel 
have two wpanusb instances using them would what I first off.
