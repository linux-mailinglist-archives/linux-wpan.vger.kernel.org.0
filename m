I based my programs off the af_packet_rx and af_packet_tx examples.

Sorry for the misunderstanding, I'll try to explain it better.
This is the data flow currently:

[GNU Radio]--UDP socket-->[program 1]--raw wpan socket-->[wpan0]
[GNU Radio]<--UDP socket--[program 2]<--raw wpan socket--[wpan0]
(wpan0 is a hwsim interface)

So the UDP socket is used only to transfer L2 packets to and from
GNU Radio, which is where the PHY is implemented.
This is like a SoftMAC-type radio, except the PHY is a userspace
application, and not a piece of hardware.
I'm trying to move L2 packets between my application and the wpan
interface.

Raw wpan sockets. Although I'm using ETH_P_ALL as the protocol, as the
ETH_P_IEEE802154 protocol type does not output outgoing packets.

True. In the meantime, I have been working on a possible solution for my
problem, having the program that sends packets from the wpan interface
to my GNU Radio application do the following checks:

- Source MAC or short address is equal to the wpan interface's
- Destination MAC or short address is not equal to that of the wpan
interface
- Destination MAC or short address is equal to the broadcast address

I think this should avoid causing a loop. I haven't finished
implementing these features yet, so I don't know if they will be
effective.
It's not the same as having proper flow control, though. I would need
to implement a flow control mechanism to avoid this problem, I think.
