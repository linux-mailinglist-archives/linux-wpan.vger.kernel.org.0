For me, trigger and done should be for the simple cli use case in one
command like "scan list". It will block them and trigger any scan
event popping up. The user can send SIGINT to stop scanning?

Although there should be still available an asynchronous way which is
for me "scan trigger" (non-blocking) and the user can do "iwpan
monitor" to observe upcoming events (all inclusive scan) and tell
optionally "scan done" to stop scanning if necessary (which probably
also produces an event to notify all listeners e.g. iwpan monitor).

However I think most people using iwpan want to trigger and wait and
the cli is filling up events and blocks until it's done (that would be
a combination with trigger/monitor into one command).

Both solutions should be possible over cli?

Does this sound okay?
